Twitter_trends
==============

   This project is designed to develop a geographic visualization of Twitter data across the United States. This program helps to understand how people in different states feel about a particular state. The data was created by collecting public Twitter posts that have been tagged with geographic locations and filtering for those that contain the "state_name" query term. --Rafayel Mkrtchyan, March 3, 2014
